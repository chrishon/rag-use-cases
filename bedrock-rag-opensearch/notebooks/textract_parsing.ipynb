       " Document(page_content='Table of Contents\\n\\n\\nThe Company\\'s business is subject to seasonal fluctuation, with significant portions of net sales and net income being realized during the\\n\\n\\nfourth quarter of the fiscal year due to the holiday selling season. The results for the 13 and 39 weeks ended October 28, 2023 are not\\n\\n\\nnecessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the fiscal year ending February 3, 2024, or for any other future interim period or for\\n\\n\\nany future year.\\n\\n\\nThese unaudited interim consolidated financial statements and the related notes should be read in conjunction with the consolidated\\n\\n\\nfinancial statements and notes included in the Company\\'s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended January 28, 2023. All amounts\\n\\n\\nare stated in thousands, with the exception of per share amounts and number of stores.\\n\\n\\n2. Summary of significant accounting policies\\n\\n\\nInformation regarding significant accounting policies is contained in Note 2, \"Summary of significant accounting policies,\" to the\\n\\n\\nconsolidated financial statements in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended January 28, 2023.

Actual results could differ from those\\n\\n\\nestimates. The Company considers its accounting policies relating to inventory valuations, vendor allowances, impairment of long-lived\\n\\n\\ntangible and right-of-use assets, loyalty program and income taxes to be the most significant accounting policies that involve management\\n\\n\\nestimates and judgments. Significant changes, if any, in those estimates and assumptions resulting from continuing changes in the economic\\n\\n\\nenvironment will be reflected in the consolidated financial statements in future periods.\\n\\n\\n3.

In addition, inflation could materially increase the interest rates on any outstanding debt.\\n\\n\\nBasis of presentation\\n\\n\\nThe Company has one reportable segment, which includes retail stores, salon services, and e-commerce.\\n\\n\\nWe recognize merchandise revenue at the point of sale in our retail stores. E-commerce sales are recognized upon shipment or guest pickup\\n\\n\\nof the merchandise based on meeting the transfer of control criteria. Retail store and e-commerce sales are recorded net of estimated\\n\\n\\nreturns. Shipping and handling are treated as costs to fulfill the contract and not a separate performance obligation. Accordingly, we\\n\\n\\nrecognize revenue for our single performance obligation related to online sales at the time control of the merchandise passes to the\\n\\n\\ncustomer, which is at the time of shipment or guest pickup. We provide refunds for merchandise returns within 60 days from the original\\n\\n\\npurchase date. State sales taxes are presented on a net basis as we consider our self a pass-through conduit for collecting and remitting state\\n\\n\\nsales tax. Salon service revenue is recognized at the time the service is provided to the guest. Gift card sales revenue is deferred until the\\n\\n\\nguest redeems the gift card. Company coupons and other incentives are recorded as a reduction of net sales. Other revenue includes the\\n\\n\\nprivate label and co-branded credit card programs, royalties derived from the partnership with Target Corporation, and deferred revenue\\n\\n\\nrelated to the loyalty program and gift card breakage.\\n\\n\\nComparable sales reflect sales for stores beginning on the first day of the 14th month of operation. Therefore, a store is included in our\\n\\n\\ncomparable store base on the first day of the period after one year of operations plus the initial one-month grand opening period. Non-\\n\\n\\ncomparable store sales include sales from new stores that have not yet completed their 13th month of operation and stores that were closed\\n\\n\\nfor part or all of the period in either year. Remodeled stores are included in comparable sales unless the store was closed for a portion of the\\n\\n\\ncurrent or prior period. Comparable sales include retail sales, salon services, and e-commerce. In fiscal years with 53 weeks, the 53rd week\\n\\n\\nof comparable sales is included in the calculation. In the year following a 53-week year, the prior year period is shifted by one week to\\n\\n\\ncompare similar calendar weeks. There may be variations in the way in which some of our competitors and other retailers calculate\\n\\n\\ncomparable or same store sales.\\n\\n\\nMeasuring comparable sales allows us to evaluate the performance of our store base as well as several other aspects of our overall strategy.\\n\\n\\nSeveral factors could positively or negatively impact our comparable sales results:\\n\\n\\nthe general national, regional, and local economic conditions and corresponding impact on customer spending levels;\\n\\n\\n16\\n', metadata={'source': 's3://knowledgebasestack-knowledgebasedocumentsfd6cf24d-zfoejyb8fwrp/0001558370-23-019393.pdf', 'page': 16}),\n",

The Loan Agreement contains a requirement to maintain a fixed charge\\n\\n\\ncoverage ratio of not less than 1.0 to 1.0 during such periods when availability under the Loan Agreement falls below a specified threshold.\\n\\n\\nSubstantially all of the Company's assets are pledged as collateral for outstanding borrowings under the Loan Agreement.

Any\\n\\n\\ndecrease in sales during these higher sales volume periods could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or operating\\n\\n\\nresults for the entire fiscal year.

The preparation of these consolidated\\n\\n\\nfinancial statements required the use of estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of our assets, liabilities, revenues, and\\n\\n\\nexpenses. Management bases estimates on historical experience and other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances\\n\\n\\nand evaluates these estimates on an on-going basis.
